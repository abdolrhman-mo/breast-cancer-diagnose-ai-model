# 🎯 Breast Cancer Diagnosis Model Dashboard

A specialized Streamlit dashboard for breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning models with focus on maximum recall (sensitivity) for medical applications.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The dashboard is built with a modular architecture for better maintainability and extensibility:

```
ui/
├── main_app.py                 # Main Streamlit application orchestrator
├── data_manager.py            # Data loading, preprocessing, and model training
├── ui_pages/                  # Individual page modules
│   ├── __init__.py           # Package initialization
│   └── technical_implementation_page.py  # Technical details page
└── README.md                  # This file
```
